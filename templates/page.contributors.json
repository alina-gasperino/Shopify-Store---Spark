His constructed worlds of uncertainty exist on plane between waking and sleeping, where he is tormented by a physical embrace of the subconscious and its perils, all while being paralyzed in bed. Influences of 19th-century Romanticists, historical texts of occultism, and dream symbolism lace each composition with various visual dialogues of the macabre. <\/p><p>Follow Nicolas: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/nicolasbruno\/\"><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">@nicolasbruno<\/span><\/a><\/p>",
